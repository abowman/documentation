The Design Board is the visible area that you can use to define your application user interface. It is where controls are created, drawn and edited. The Design Board in Creo in much more than a static representation of your controls, it reflects changes from the Inspector and it is able to display data from a DataSet. The Design Board can also show you how your application behaves and runs on different devices and orientations.

### View menu
Under the View menu there are several options that can change Design Board default behaviour. Among others, there are options to show/hide rules or to enable/disable smart guides. One useful feature is the **Clip Objects To Bounds** and when enabled, it hides anything outside device outline (like if it was running inside a real physical device). The following example shows you the same project with **Clip Objects To Bounds** turned on and then off.
