Every application requires assets like images, sounds, movies and generic documents. The Assets folder is the central repository for all your resources. Simply drop an asset from the Finder to Creo to automatically have it copied into your project's Assets folder.

### Images

Every app needs a beautiful and memorable icon that attracts attention in the App Store and stands out on the Home screen. Your icon is the first opportunity to communicate, at a glance, your appâ€™s purpose.

It also appears throughout the system, such as in Settings and search results. You can manually provide each required image at each required resolution (12 images are required at the time of writing) or you can use the built-in icon generator to let Creo automatically creates all required icons for you. Please note that you should use your higher resolution image in this case.
