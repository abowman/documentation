Buttons initiate app-specific actions, have customizable backgrounds, and can include a title or an icon. The system provides a number of predefined button styles for most use cases. You can also design fully custom buttons.

A simple `Button`.

### Best practices
When you tap a button, the button performs an action where the user can execute custom source code.
A button is tipically used by the user to execute custom actions like open a `Window` or just play an `Animation`.

### How to use
1. Add a button to a `Window`
2. Configure every desired propery from the `Inspector` like `Title` and `Style`
3. From the `View` application menu open the `Actions Panel`  and click on the `Code Editor` menu item
4. Select the `Action` item over the `Events` area and add your custom code in the `Code Editor`

### Most important properties
Several UI aspects can be configured in the `Button` class but the `Title` and `Style` are the most populars to be configured.
