### Best practices

### How to use
1. Drop a `CLASS_NAME` control from the object panel to a `Window`
2. Use the `CLASS_NAME Inspector` to customize its properties like `prop1`, `prop2`, and `prop3`
If you need to write code for CLASS_NAME:
3. Open the `Code Editor` (cmd + 6)
4. Select the `MAIN_ACTION_NAME_HERE` item inside the `Events` area and write your custom code in the `Code Editor`

### Example
A very simple example about CLASS_NAME. Sample code should be as simple as possible, a Console.write most of the time makes a lot of sense. DO NOT USE Control1.value if value is passed as parameter and in any case use self.value. DO NOT HARDCODE control's name otherwise you'll end up with NON PORTABLE CODE,
```
Console.write("CLASS_NAME value: \(self.value)")
```

### Most important properties
Several UI aspects can be configured in the `CLASS_NAME` class but the `PROP1`, `PROP2`, and `PROP3` are the most populars to be configured.
- `PROP1`: A PROP1 description.
- `PROP2`: A PROP2 description.
- `PROP3`: A PROP3 description.
