![How to use Creo](images/creo_intro_2.png)

Every mobile application requires three basic foundamental ingredients:

1. a way to display and navigate between different parts of your application
2. a way to present information to the end user
3. a way to retrieve and transform data from very different sources

**Creo** lets you: 

1. compose complex navigation hierarchy in the [Layout](layout.md) section
2. build fully featured and rich interface in the [Design Board](design-board.md) section
3. connect data to user interface using [DataSet](data-set.md) like databases, HTTP requests, files, sensors and much more

**Creo** is a next generation tool that lets you combine design and development in order to build better applications in a fraction of time compared to traditional tools.
