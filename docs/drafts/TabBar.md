A tab bar appears at the bottom of an app screen and provides the ability to quickly switch between different sections of an app. Tab bars are translucent, may have a background tint, maintain the same height in all screen orientations, and are hidden when a keyboard is displayed. A tab bar may contain any number of tabs, but the number of visible tabs varies based on the device size and orientation. If some tabs canâ€™t be displayed due to limited horizontal space, the final visible tab becomes a More tab, which reveals the additional tabs in a list on a separate screen.

### Best practices
When an application has multiple sections then `TabBar` is usually the root screen and is used to present a clear interface to switch between the sections, ie:

- the sections of a social app: 1 screen for the feeds, 1 screen for the user profile, 1 for creating new posts and so on

- the sections of a navigator app: 1 screen for driving informations, 1 screen to explore your surrounding and 1 for the public transport

### How to use
1. add a `TabBar` as a root screen and customize the appearance, ie translucent, tint and so on
1. add 1 or more child `Window` or `Navigation`
1. for each childrencustomize its `TABBAR Item` by tapping the _(+)_ icon

#### Example
- start adding a `TabBar` by tapping the _New Navigation_ button on the _bottom bar_

- configure the `TabBar` by adding `Window` or `Navigation` child screens

- configure each screen to add a `TABBAR Item` 
- keep doing the same until you have a hierarchy like this

![New TabBar](images/tabbar5.png)

```
- TabBar
  - Navigation1 (startup window)  
    - TabBarItem1
    - Window1
  - Navigation2
    - TabBarItem1
    - Window2
  - Navigation3
    - TabBarItem1
    - Window3
```

**Note:**

it is common practice to drop `Navigation` as the child of a `TabBar` and configure the `Navigation Bar` setting `Hide Navigation Bar` to _true_.

#### Interacting using Gravity

`TABBAR Item` properties can be set by code, ie

```
Navigation1.TabbarItem1.badgeValue = "10"
```

### Subnodes
The `TABBAR Item` can be created by tapping the subnode icon _(+)_, the top settings include:

- A custom title
- A badge value
- An icon

The icon can both be custom (with a user provided image) or selected from the list of system _TabBar_ icons.

**Note:** without the _TABBAR Item_ the title itself is automatically retrieved from the name of the current children `Window`.

### UI Properties
Several UI aspects can be configured but (see the inspector) but usually you want to set the `TabBar` tint color to match your ui
