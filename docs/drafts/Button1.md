Buttons initiate app-specific actions, have customizable backgrounds, and can include a title or an icon. The system provides a number of predefined button styles for most use cases. You can also design fully custom buttons.

### Best practices
When you tap a button, the button performs an action where the user can execute custom source code.
A button is tipically used by the user to execute custom actions like open a `Window` or just play an `Animation`.

### How to use
1. Add a button to a `Window`
2. Configure every desired propery from the `Inspector` like `Title` and `Style`
3. Open the `Code Editor` clicking the `View` ->  `Actions Panel`  -> `Code Editor` menu item
4. Select the `Action` item inside the `Events` area and write your custom code in the `Code Editor`
