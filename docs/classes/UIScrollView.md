**super**: [UIView](UIView.md) on iOS

This class is reserved and cannot be directly instantiated.



### Events

* **DidScroll**()
This event is called when the user scrolls the content view.

* **DidEndDragging**(**decelerate**: <strong>[Bool](../gravity/types.md)</strong>)
This event is called when dragging ended in the scroll view. The scroll view sends this event when the userâ€™s finger touches up after dragging content. The decelerating property of the scroll view controls deceleration. The decelerate value is true if the scrolling movement will continue, but decelerate, after a touch-up gesture during a dragging operation. If the value is NO, scrolling stops immediately upon touch-up.

* **DidEndDecelerating**()
This event is called when the scroll view ends decelerating the scrolling movement.



### Properties

* **var** **contentOffset**: **[Point](point.md)**
The point at which the origin of the content view is offset from the origin of the scroll view.

* **var** **contentSize**: **[Size](size.md)**
The size of the content view.

* **var** **contentInset**: **[EdgeInsets](edgeinsets.md)**
The distance that the content view is inset from the enclosing scroll view. Use this property to add to the scrolling area around the content.

* **var** **bounces**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
Boolean value that controls whether the scroll view bounces past the edge of content and back again. Bouncing visually indicates that scrolling has reached an edge of the content.

* **var** **alwaysBounceVertical**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether bouncing always occurs when vertical scrolling reaches the end of the content.

* **var** **alwaysBounceHorizontal**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether bouncing always occurs when horizontal scrolling reaches the end of the content view.

* **var** **pagingEnabled**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether paging is enabled for the scroll view.

* **var** **scrollEnabled**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
A Boolean value that determines whether scrolling is enabled. When scrolling is disabled, the scroll view does not accept touch events; it forwards them up the responder chain.

* **var** **showsHorizontalScrollIndicator**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
A Boolean value that controls whether the horizontal scroll indicator is visible. The indicator is visible while tracking is underway and fades out after tracking.

* **var** **showsVerticalScrollIndicator**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
A Boolean value that controls whether the vertical scroll indicator is visible. The indicator is visible while tracking is underway and fades out after tracking.

* **var** **scrollIndicatorInsets**: **[EdgeInsets](edgeinsets.md)**
The distance the scroll indicators are inset from the edge of the scroll view.

* **var** **indicatorStyle**: **ScrollViewIndicatorStyle**
The style of the scroll indicators.

* **var** **decelerating**: **[Bool](../gravity/types.md)**
Returns whether the content is moving in the scroll view after the user lifted their finger. \(read-only\)



### Methods

* **func** **flashScrollIndicators**()
Displays the scroll indicators momentarily. You should call this method whenever you bring the scroll view to front.





### Enumeration

#### ScrollViewIndicatorStyle
 * .Black
