A subnode is an child object of a Window/Navigation object.  Subnodes modify the default appearance of the parent object.  Objects with a (+) symbol to the right in the Layout panel can be customized with subnodes.  Clicking on the (+) symbol will show a list of the available subnodes.

For example, to customize the title of a Window when it is contained inside a Navigation, just press the (+) button and select a TitleItem under Navigation Bar group. From the TitleItem's Inspector you'll be able to customize the icon, the title and several other options.

Note that you'll see how the Window will appear inside a Navigation ONLY when that Window will be presented inside a navigation control.
