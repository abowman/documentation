### Best practices
* **Select the chart type that represents better your data.** You can change a chart from one type to anotherâ€”for example, from a pie chart to a bar chart, or from a line chart to an area chart.

### How to use
1. Drop a `Chart` control from the object panel to a `Window`
2. Use the `Chart Inspector` to customize its properties like `Type`, `Colors`, and `DataSet`

### Example
1. Drop a `Button` control from the object panel to a `Window`
2. Open the `Code Editor` (cmd + 6)
3. Select the `Action` item inside the `Events` area and write your custom code in the `Code Editor`
```
Chart1.chartType = ChartType.Area
```

### Most important properties
Several UI aspects can be configured in the `Chart` class but the `chartType` and `dataSet` are the most commons to be configured.
- `chartType`:  The graphical representation type
- `dataSet`: The `DataSet` object provides information that Chart needs to construct its content.
